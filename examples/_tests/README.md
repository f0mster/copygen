# Examples: Tests

The examples in this folder are used for testing.


| Test   | Description                                                 |
| :----- | :---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Alias  | Uses an alias import (for a copied struct).                 |
| Cyclic | Uses a nested struct (containing a field of the same type). |

## Integration Tests

The command line interface is straightforward. The loader uses a tested library. The matcher matches fields to other fields, which the generator depends on. Field-matching is heavily dependent on the `parser`, which provides the User Interface for end users _(developers)_. As a result, the `parser` contains the majority of edge cases this program encounters. Testing the entire program from end-to-end is more effective than unit tests for each package.

Run integration tests using `go test ./examples/_tests` from `/copygen`.
